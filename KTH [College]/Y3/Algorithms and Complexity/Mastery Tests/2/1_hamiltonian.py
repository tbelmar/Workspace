Hamiltonian Path
Inputs:
    Vertices (V)
    Edges(E)

Output:
    True if the following conditions can be met:
        1) Every vertex is visited by continuously visiting neighbors (any starting vertex is allowed)
        2) A vertex is never visited twice
    
    False otherwise


Firing Problem
Inputs:
    Number of Business-critical tasks (n)
    Total number of employees (m)
    Number of employees to fire (k)
    Lists of which employees each task can be done by (Tasks)
        Tasks.length == n
    
Output:
    True if the following conditions can be met:
        1) k employees get fired
        2) For every task (t) in Tasks, there are 3
    False otherwise
